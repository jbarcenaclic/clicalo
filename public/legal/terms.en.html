  <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
  <p>Last updated: May 29, 2025</p>
  <p>1. Acceptance of Terms

    Welcome to CLÍCALO. By accessing and using this platform, you expressly and irrevocably accept these Terms and Conditions of Use. If you do not agree with any of these terms, please refrain from using the platform.
    
    2. Nature of the Platform and Rewards
    
    CLÍCALO is a digital incentive platform that allows users to participate in voluntary digital activities (such as watching ads, answering surveys, clicking on promotions, etc.) in exchange for symbolic rewards.
    
    These rewards do not constitute salary, professional services, employment relationships, or commercial commissions under any circumstances.
    
    Rewards are symbolic and occasional, provided as an incentive for voluntary participation in the platform’s activities.
    
    3. Reward and Withdrawal Limits
    
    Rewards are subject to a maximum monthly withdrawal limit of $7,500 MXN per user.
    
    Withdrawals can only be requested once the user has accumulated a minimum balance of $300 MXN.
    
    CLÍCALO reserves the right to modify these limits at any time, notifying users via the platform.
    
    4. Code Generation and Validity Policies
    
    When generating a redemption code, the corresponding amount will be immediately deducted from the user’s available balance.
    
    Each code is valid for 72 hours. If not used within this time, the balance will be refunded to the user.
    
    Codes are non-transferable and cannot be redeemed for cash outside of official channels.
    
    5. Disclaimer of Liability
    
    CLÍCALO does not guarantee the continuous availability of paid actions or specific reward amounts.
    
    It will not be responsible for temporary or permanent suspension of the platform due to force majeure, technical issues, or business decisions.
    
    CLÍCALO is not liable for a user's inability to withdraw funds if they fail to meet the platform’s conditions.
    
    6. Appropriate Use of the Platform
    
    The use of bots, automation, IP manipulation, VPNs, or any fraudulent practice to gain rewards illicitly is strictly prohibited.
    
    Violation of this rule may result in immediate and permanent account suspension, as well as loss of accumulated balances.
    
    7. Jurisdiction and Applicable Law
    
    This agreement is governed by the laws of the United Mexican States.
    
    Any dispute arising from this agreement will be submitted to the competent courts of Mexico City, waiving any other jurisdiction.
    
    8. Modifications to the Terms
    
    CLÍCALO reserves the right to modify, update, or delete these Terms and Conditions at any time. Changes will take effect upon publication on the platform. Continued use of the platform constitutes acceptance of such modifications.
    
    By using CLÍCALO, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and fully accepted these Terms and Conditions.
